## 📊 Data Requirements

- **Notebooks 1-3:** Work out of the box with real-time CPCB data
- **Notebook 4 (PM2.5):** Requires GEOJson files of region of interest

## 🎯 Use Cases

These notebooks cover:

- ✅ **Data Exploration:** Discover available monitoring stations and locations
- ✅ **Real-time Monitoring:** Track air quality changes as they happen
- ✅ **Historical Analysis:** Understand pollution trends over time
- ✅ **Geographic Analysis:** Analyze air quality across different regions
- ✅ **Visualization:** Create informative plots and maps
- ✅ **Alert Systems:** Set up notifications for unhealthy air quality

## 💡 Tips

1. **Start with Notebook 1** if you're new to vayuayan
2. **Uncomment code blocks** marked with `# Uncomment to run` when you're ready to execute them
3. **Customize locations** by changing coordinates to your area of interest
4. **Save your work** frequently - some analyses may take time
5. **Check data availability** - historical data may not be complete for all locations

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import errors:**
```bash
pip install --upgrade vayuayan pandas matplotlib geopandas
```

**Network timeouts:**
- Check your internet connection
- Some CPCB endpoints may be temporarily unavailable
- Try again after a few minutes

**Missing data:**
- Not all cities have complete historical data
- Some monitoring stations may be offline
- PM2.5 netCDF files must be downloaded separately
